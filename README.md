# Timetable Planner NTU
*Last Updated*: 1st Draft - 07/December/2024

*Columns in the csv file*: Course Code, Course Name, Index, Type, Group, Day, Time, Venue, Remark

The reason for creating this notebook is to make it easy for me to plan out my schedule for the next semester. 

So far the notebook is just filtering the data based on the Course, specific Day + Time, & multiple Days & Time.

**Future Plan**

I plan to create the CSV file needed based on the data from the NTU Planner webpage through web scraping. If it's not possible due to security reason, I can download the PDF or HTML format of the NTU Planner webpage and filter the modules that I only want to use to plan.
